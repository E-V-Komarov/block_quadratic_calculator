# Quadratic Equation Calculator

## This project implements a quadratic equation calculator with the following features:

* Calculates roots of quadratic equations (ax^2 + bx + c = 0)
* Stores calculation history in a database
* User interface for inputting coefficients and viewing results
* Input validation to ensure correct data format
* Written with strict type declarations (declare(strict_types=1))

## To Use:

Download the source code.
Install any necessary dependencies.
Run the application or install the Moodle block plugin as per the instructions.
Enter the coefficients (a, b, c) of the quadratic equation and click "Calculate".
The calculated roots (x1 and x2) will be displayed, along with an option to save the results to the database.
